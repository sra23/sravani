<p>The first personal computers come about in the late 1960s and 1970s. HP is at the forefront. <big>HP develops its first “personal computer,”</big> a scientific calculator called the HP 9100A. Ads for the calculator coin the term, “personal computer.”</p>
<p><u>HP was founded by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard </u>in 1939. Their first product was an audio oscillator and one of their first customers Walt Disney. Disney used the oscillator to test audio equipment in the 12 specially equipped theaters showing Fantasia in 1940. HP entered the computer market with the HP 2116A in 1966.</p>
